display: 
  how element layout its children
  ex: 
    display: block
      - Take full width by default if width not specified
      - Always start on new line
      => elements: div, p, h1, h2,.., footer, header, form, article

    display: inline
      - Take wrap width
      - Will continue the previous element
      => elements: span, a, img,...

    display: inline-block
      - is inline but also set width, height 
    
    display: flex
position: 
  how this element is positioned

  position: relative
    top: 10px
    left: 10px
    => like Transform.translate(offset: Offset(10, 10))

  position: absolute
    top: 32px
    left: 32px
    => align from the position of nearest parent

  position: fixed
    bottom: 32px,
    right: 32px

    => like set FAB button pos
    => = absolute with parent is html tag
    BUT element is STILL  moved when scroll   
  
    position: sticky
    => like fixed but sticky on scroll
    
  position: static (default)
  => top, left, z-index, ... will be ignore
  => there's no special position 
  => the position of element will be decided based on its display
